# UnderstandingTheServer

<!-- In today's code we will be laerning the fundamentals of a Server for your website. Here is what you need to know about servers.
<!-- A server is basically a big box kind of thing that will allow users to access your website. We use servers for a lot of things.
<!-- Such as forms. For example, you are trying to make a support form for users to contact you if the server is not working.
<!-- They fill out the form, and then hit the button that says "Submit." When they hit the button, it won't do anything 
<!-- unless in your code you contact the server to deliver the message to the business email. A more effortless way of understanding
<!-- this is that when you go to a restaraunt, lets say you have a party of 4. You tell the server you want a table, but you donn't specify how much people are in your party. Same way with coding, if you dont tell the server something specific it won't do anything.
